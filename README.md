This started as tiny pet project to send a daily mailer of current affairs and political news.

# Overview
This script achieves the following:
1. Retrieves all political news generated in the last day using [worldnewsapi.com](worldnewsapi.com)
2. Ranks received articles using a weighted score generated on the basis of the title, summary, source and sentiment
3. Arranges the articles into an HTML body
4. Sends the articles to a set of recipients
